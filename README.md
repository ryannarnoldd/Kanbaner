## Usage

The usage of this application is simple. Once logged in, the user can create tickets that are either Todo, In Progress, or Done. Under the creation of the ticket, you need to specify the title, description of the ticket, and what user it belongs to. Once created, you can view the board of all the tickets and delete/edit tickets, as needed.
